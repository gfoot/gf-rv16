Constants used on bus A:

    0x00	
    0x01	SLTU
    0x03	ECALL
    0x05	*IRQ
    0x7f	SGTZ
    0xff	

0x00 can be output from the immediate system.

ECALL and *IRQ could use immediate bits in the instruction to set their constants

SLTU could probably manage without 0x01 if it used marn (i.e. mar = 0xff+c ; rd_lo = marn )
